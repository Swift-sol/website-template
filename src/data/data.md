# Website template 

Welcome! This project is to create website of one page in a few minutes. 



## Project Structure 

#### Folders

* `data`: Put here your file data in Markdown format. Call it `data.md`

#### Files

* `App.js`: Here is application code. Only that you need to understand is that we get the information from `data.md` and convert it with `Markdown` component and then we submit converted in a page.  

* `App.css`: Put here your *CSS* code. Remember this to apply styles:
